## üõí E-Commerce Clickstream Analytics on AWS

## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates a real-time data ingestion and analytics pipeline for eCommerce clickstream data.
A Python producer script simulates user activity (clicks, views, add-to-cart, purchases, etc.) and streams it into AWS services for storage, querying, monitoring, and visualization.

## üìë JSON Event Schema

Each JSON event has the following fields:

| Field       | Type   | Description                                  |
|-------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| user_id     | string | Unique identifier for the user               |
| session_id  | string | Unique session tracking ID                   |
| event_type  | string | Action type (view, click, add_to_cart, purchase) |
| page        | string | Page visited (home, product, checkout, etc.) |
| product_id  | string | Product identifier                           |
| timestamp   | string | Event timestamp (ISO 8601)                   |
| device_type | string | Device used (mobile, desktop, tablet)        |
| referrer_url| string | Source of traffic                            |
| location    | string | User‚Äôs region/country                        |
| browser     | string | Browser used                                 |
| user_type   | string | New vs returning customer                    |

# AWS Data Pipeline Architecture

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components

1. Python Producer (producer.py)

   Simulates events and streams them to Kinesis Firehose.

   Produces ~1 event/sec (configurable).

2. Amazon Kinesis Firehose

   Ingests events and delivers them to S3 Raw bucket.

3. Amazon S3 (Raw & Processed Buckets)

   Raw JSON logs stored in one bucket.

   Processed data (query results, Parquet) stored in another bucket.

4. AWS Glue Data Catalog
 
   Provides schema + metadata for querying with Athena.

5. Amazon Athena

   Runs SQL queries on clickstream data.

6. Amazon QuickSight

   Dashboards for funnel analysis, product performance, user engagement.

7. Amazon CloudWatch

   Monitors ingestion pipeline health + Firehose delivery metrics.

### üöÄ How to Run

üîë Prerequisites

AWS account with access to: Kinesis, S3, Glue, Athena, QuickSight, CloudWatch

<img src="screenshots/sc%201.png" width="400">

Python 3.8+

Install dependencies:

pip install boto3 faker

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Producer

python producer.py

<img src="screenshots/sc%202.png" width="400">

This generates synthetic JSON events and pushes them to Kinesis Firehose ‚Üí S3 Raw bucket.

üìä Insights

1.The dashboards highlight key patterns in user behavior, device usage, and regional engagement:

2.User behavior shows that most activity starts with views and clicks, but there is a clear drop between add-to-cart and purchases, pointing to potential cart abandonment issues.

3.Device and browser trends indicate that mobile and tablet users show strong engagement, with browser preferences varying. Chrome and Safari dominate on desktop, while Edge and Firefox are more common on mobile. This suggests the need for a mobile-first optimization strategy with attention to cross-browser compatibility.

4.Regional insights reveal high engagement in Mumbai and Berlin, with device preferences differing by region. Mumbai users lean towards tablets, while Tokyo and Berlin show higher mobile adoption.

5.User types show that the majority of activity comes from returning users, reflecting loyalty. However, acquisition efforts should be strengthened to attract more new users.

6.Traffic sources highlight strong inflow from Google and Twitter, followed by Facebook, showing that marketing campaigns on these platforms are driving meaningful traffic.

Overall, the insights suggest focusing on:

1.Improving the mobile and tablet experience, since those devices dominate engagement.

2.Reducing cart abandonment, possibly through retargeting or better checkout design.

3.Personalizing strategies by region and browser type for maximum impact.

4.Balancing user acquisition with retention efforts to sustain long-term growth.

üìä CloudWatch Monitoring

   In this project, CloudWatch is configured to monitor the health of the ingestion and analytics pipeline:

1. Kinesis Firehose Metrics:

   Records successfully delivered to S3

   Failed delivery attempts

2. S3 Buckets (Raw & Processed):

   Object creation logs (new files landing in raw and processed buckets)

3. Athena Queries:

   Query execution times

   Query failures

   CloudWatch dashboards and alarms were set up to track these metrics, ensuring pipeline reliability.
